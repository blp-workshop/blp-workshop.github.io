### Call for Papers: Bangla Language Processing Workshop (2nd Edition)

The second edition of the Bangla Language Processing Workshop will spotlight the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for Bangla. This year’s focus is on evaluating the current state-of-the-art and advancing research in generative AI across NLP, speech, and multimodal domains. The workshop seeks to foster collaboration and innovation in developing methodologies that can be scaled to support other low-resource languages.

We invite researchers to submit original work presenting novel approaches and resources that advance Bangla and other low-resource languages. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, large language models (LLMs), domain-specialized LLMs, and efficient methods designed for low-resource or low-computation settings.

**We invite original research papers from a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:**
<br>

**1. Natural Language Processing**
- LLMs Capabilities:
  * World knowledge
  * Common sense reasoning
  * Reading comprehension
  * Cultural understanding, among others.
- Standard NLP tasks
  * Corpus and Resource Development
  * Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics
  * Language Modeling
  * Information Extraction
  * Information Retrieval and Text Mining

Accepted papers will be given up to 9 pages (for full papers), 5 pages (for short papers and posters) in the workshop proceedings, and will be presented as oral paper or poster. Workshop proceedings will be published through [ACL anthology](https://aclanthology.org/). Please check the papers published in the [first iteration](https://aclanthology.org/2023.banglalp-1.0/).

**We are seeking submissions under the following categories:**
<br>
- We are seeking submissions under the following category
- Full/long papers (8 pages)
- Short papers (work in progress, innovative ideas/proposals: 4 pages)
- Shared task papers (4 pages)

***Note:*** *Limitations, ethics statements and references are excluded from page limit.*

Long, short and shared tasks papers must follow the ARR two-column format, using the supplied <a href="https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp/" target="_blank">ARR --> Paper Submission Process, Criteria and Templates</a>. The [templates](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) can be downloaded in style files and formatting. Please do not modify these style files, nor  should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review. Verification to guarantee conformance to publication standards, we will be using the <a href="https://github.com/acl-org/aclpubcheck" target="_blank">ACL pubcheck tool</a>. The PDFs of camera-ready papers must be run through this tool prior to their final submission, and we recommend its use also at submission time.

Submissions are open to all, and are to be submitted anonymously. For the anonymity, double-blind submission and reproducibility criteria please follow the <a href="https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp" target="_blank">ARR --> Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review</a>.

**If you have published in the field previously, and are interested in helping out in the program committee to review papers, please fill up <a href="https://forms.gle/1WUYQjWT9UuqioX48" target="_blank">this form</a>.

#### Submission portal
Submissions must be made using the <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/AACL-IJCNLP/2025/Workshop/BLP" target="_blank">OpenReview portal</a>. Every author of the paper needs to register in OpenReview.
