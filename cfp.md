<!--## *The First Bangla Language Processing Workshop (BLP 2023) Co-located with EMNLP 2023 in Singapore*-->


### Call for Papers
The First Bangla Language Processing Workshop workshop aims to provide a forum for the NLP, speech and multimodal communities to share and discuss their ongoing work with the international community. We particularly focus on Bangla, which is a low-resource language, and assess its current state-of-the-art and discuss strategies to make further progress in NLP, speech and multimodal research.

Through this workshop, we plan to bring researchers together to come up with frameworks and strategies that can later support other low-resource languages. We encourage researchers to submit their papers focusing on novel methodologies and resources that help towards the progress of Bangla and other low resource languages. Novel methodologies include, but are not limited to, zero-shot learning, unsupervised learning, and simple yet effective methods applicable to low-computation scenarios.

**We invite original research papers from a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:**
<br>

**1. Natural Language Processing**
* Corpus and Resource Development
* Language Modeling
* Stemmer
* POS Tagger
* Named Entity Recognition
* Relation Extraction
* Spell and Grammar Checker
* Question Answering

* Text Summarization
* Machine Translation
* Sentiment Analysis

**2. Speech Processing**
* Speech Synthesis and Spoken Language Generation
* Speech Recognition
* Phonetics
