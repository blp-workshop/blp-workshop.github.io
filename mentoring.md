<h3 id="pre-submission-mentoring">Pre-submission Mentoring</h3>
<p>We are launching a pre-submission mentoring program in a limited scale. We are adapting this from the pre-submission mentoring program in other <a href="https://2022.naacl.org/calls/workshop-mentoring" target="_blank">*CL conferences</a>.</p>

<p>We hope this program can help create a path for prospective BLP authors who would not otherwise have considered participating in, or working on a submission to the workshop. We hope to establish valuable connections and first-hand training for these early-career researchers throughout the submission process. This program will provide the authors access to mentors who will provide them feedback on: (i) polishing the draft (ii) suggesting any missing experiments (iii) discussing interesting directions to extend the work etc.</p>

<p>To this end, we are starting a pre-submission mentoring program that begins on September 5th and will run until the paper submission deadline.</p>

<h4 id="information-for-mentees">Information for Mentees</h4>
<p>To apply to be a mentee, please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/hYReTeaYmH644ZNd9" target="_blank">form</a> by August 30th. Please provide as much information you can so that we can find out a good match. Getting a mentor is not guarranted.</p>

<h4 id="important-notes">Important Notes:</h4>
<p>For any questions related to specific workshop submission deadlines, submission instructions and policies, please reach out to the workshop organizers.</p>

<p>Please note that submitting to this mentoring program does not submit your work to a workshop automatically. You will still need to make a submission to your workshop of interest before their specified deadline(s).</p>

<h4 id="mentormentees-expectation">Mentor/Mentees Expectation</h4>
<p>Mentors are encouraged to provide feedback addressing the following questions (among others):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the main claim of the work justified and communicated well?</li>
  <li>What weaknesses might affect paper acceptance, and how can those be addressed?</li>
  <li>What additions could make the paper stronger?</li>
  <li>How can the structure and presentation of the paper be improved?</li>
  <li>Mentors and mentees are expected to communicate via email and/or video/audio chat. We encourage mentors and mentees to schedule regular check-ins before the submission deadline.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will have a mid-way check-in in September to check if the match is going well.</p>

<p>Time commitment expected from the mentors is about 8 hours over the duration of the mentoring program.</p>
