## *The First Bangla Language Processing Workshop (BLP 2023) Co-located with EMNLP 2023 in Singapore*


### Call for Papers:
The First Bangla Language Processing Workshop workshop aims to provide a forum for the NLP, speech and multimodal communities to share and discuss their ongoing work with the international community. We particularly focus on Bangla, which is a low-resource language, and assess its current state-of-the-art and discuss strategies to make further progress in NLP, speech and multimodal research. Through this workshop, we plan to bring researchers together to come up with frameworks and strategies that can later support other low-resource languages. We encourage researchers to submit their papers focusing on novel methodologies and resources that help towards the progress of Bangla and other low resource languages. Novel methodologies include, but are not limited to, zero-shot learning, unsupervised learning, and simple yet effective methods applicable to low-computation scenarios.

**We invite original research papers from a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:**
<br>
<br>
**Natural Language Processing:** Corpus and Resource Development, Language Modeling,  Stemmer, POS Tagger, Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Spell and Grammar Checker, Question Answering, Semantics, Text Summarization, Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis.
<br>
**Speech Processing:** Speech Synthesis and Spoken Language Generation, Speech Recognition, Phonetics, Phonology, and Prosody, Spoken Dialog and Conversational System, Speaker and Language Detection.
<br>
**Multimodality:** OCR - Handwriting, Printed Document, Sign Language Detection and other areas related to multimodality
<br>
**Human Computer Interaction:** Software for Disabled People, Multimodal HCI for Bangla.

Long, short and shared tasks papers must follow the EMNLP 2023 two-column format, using the supplied official templates [1](https://2023.emnlp.org/calls/style-and-formatting/). The templates can be downloaded in style files and formatting. Please do not modify these style files, nor  should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review. Verification to guarantee conformance to publication standards, we will be using the ACL pubcheck tool [2](https://github.com/acl-org/aclpubcheck). The PDFs of camera-ready papers must be run through this tool prior to their final submission, and we recommend its use also at submission time.

Submissions are open to all, and are to be submitted anonymously. For the anonymity, double-blind submission and reproducibility criteria please follow the EMNLP 2023 instructions [3](https://2023.emnlp.org/calls/main_conference_papers/).

**If you have published in the field previously, and are interested in helping out in the program committee to review papers, please fill up this form [4](https://forms.gle/1WUYQjWT9UuqioX48)**
