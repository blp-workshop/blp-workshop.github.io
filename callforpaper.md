<!-- ## *The First Bangla Language Processing Workshop* -->

<!-- ## Broader objectives:
Bangla â€“ a member of the Indo-Aryan language family, is ranked as the 6th most widely spoken language across the world, with 230 million native speakers from Bangladesh and India1. This morphologically rich language has a long-standing literacy tradition, with diverse dialects and language dependent challenges. Bangla, with three decades of research history, is still considered a low-resource language in the natural language processing (NLP) and speech community [(Alam et al., 2021a)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03844.pdf), mainly due to the limited and scattered research efforts by individual researchers. These lines of sparse works are not highly visible to the international research community. -->


### Call for papers:
This workshop aims to provide a forum for the NLP community to share and discuss their ongoing work with the international community. We particularly focus on Bangla, which is a low-resource language, and assess its current state-of-the-art and discuss strategies to make further progress in both NLP, Speech and multimodal research. Through this workshop, we plan to bring researchers together to come up with frameworks and strategies that can later support other low-resource languages. We particularly encourage researchers to submit their papers focusing on novel methodologies and resources that help towards the progress of Bangla and other low resource languages. Novel methodologies include, but are not limited to, zero-shot learning, unsupervised learning, and simple yet effective methods applicable to low-computation scenarios.

**Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:**
<br>
**Natural Language Processing:** Corpus and Resource Development, Language Modeling,  Stemmer, POS Tagger, Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Spell and Grammar Checker, Question Answering, Semantics, Text Summarization, Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis.
<br>
**Speech Processing:** Speech Synthesis and Spoken Language Generation, Speech Recognition, Phonetics, Phonology, and Prosody, Spoken Dialog and Conversational System, Speaker and Language Detection.
<br>
**Multimodality:** OCR - Handwriting, Printed Document, Sign Language Detection and other areas related to multimodality
<br>
**Human Computer Interaction:** Software for Disabled People, Multimodal HCI for Bangla.

***All deadlines are 11:59pm anywhere on Earth (AoE)***

### Submission:
Papers must describe original, completed/ in progress and unpublished work. Each submission  will be reviewed by three program committee members. Accepted papers will be given up to 9 pages (for full papers), 5 pages (for short papers and posters) in the workshop proceedings, and will be presented as oral paper or poster. Papers should be formatted according to the EMNLP 2023  style-sheet, which is provided on the website. Please submit papers in PDF format.

**We are seeking submissions under the following categories:**
<br>
- Full papers (8 pages)
- Short papers (work in progress, innovative ideas/proposals, research proposal of students: : 4 pages)
- Shared task paper (6 pages)

Both long and short papers must follow the EMNLP 2023 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. The templates can be downloaded in  Style Files and Formatting. Please do not modify these style files, nor  should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do  not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review. Verification To guarantee conformance to publication standards, we will be using the ACL Pubcheck tool (https://github.com/acl-org/aclpubcheck). The PDFs of camera-ready papers must be run through this tool prior to their final submission, and we recommend its use also at submission time. Note that references are not included in the page count.

For the Anonymity, Double-Blind submission and Reproducibility Criteria please follow the EMNLP 2023 instructions [https://2023.emnlp.org/calls/main_conference_papers/](For the Anonymity, Double-Blind submission and Reproducibility Criteria please follow the EMNLP 2023 instructions https://2023.emnlp.org/calls/main_conference_papers/.).
