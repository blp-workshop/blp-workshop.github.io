## Tips for writing a good system description paper
* Clearly describe the problem you are trying to solve, what is the dataset, and mention the motivation behind your system design.
* Investigating the strengths and weaknesses of a system and listing them in the paper is helpful for future studies. An error analysis section is highly encouraged that will outline where the system works best and what are the cases where it fails. Is there any noticeable patterns in the mistakes?
* For the beginners, it is always beneficial to look at some other system description papers. Here are some [papers that won the best paper awards in SemEval shared tasks](https://semeval.github.io/semeval2020-awards.html). Reading these can give an idea on what are the characteristics of a good paper.
Historical SemEval papers can be found [here](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/semeval/).

* Utilize spelling and grammar checker tools.
