# Task 1: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

## Definition
This shared task will help advance the state-of-the-art in automatic speech recognition (ASR) by considering a challenging domain for ASR, with a diverse domains and a special focus on Bangla. Please see blow the domain coverage.

<!-- The field of speech analysis has undergone widespread development with the rise in popularity of virtual platforms for communication and learning. Apart from major contributions in technology accessibility Ammari et al. 2019, Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have ubiquitous applications across the spectrum, e.g., Automatic Speech Assessment for language education [^1^], and language disorder assessment and therapy [^2^]. In all such applications, the diversity of training datasets play a crucial role. For instance, if a speech recognition system is trained on only one English accent, the trained model would be susceptible to failure and be less robust for other dialects and variants of English. This is termed the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) effect, and is an active area of study in Computer Vision with a number of standard benchmarking datasets and competitions [^3^]. Contrarily, datasets for OOD benchmarking are not widespread in ASR, with researchers mostly relying on multiple datasets and assuming they are OOD [^4^]. -->
